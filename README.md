# Chemical Thesaurus Web Scraper

A number of programs used to extract the data from [The Chemical Thesaurus](https://www.chemthes.com/) and store them as JSON. 

As it doesn't have its own API I built this to extract the data I needed to build a little chemistry emulation game. You can see it [here](https://jayhal.es/shared/big-alchemy/).
